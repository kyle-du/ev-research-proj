Vehicles Placed in Service on or After April 18, 2023
-----------------------------------------------------

For vehicles delivered on or after April 18, 2023, limitations apply
that went into effect January 1, 2023, related to the vehicle's
manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), the buyer's modified
adjusted gross income, and the vehicle's battery capacity. A North
American final assembly requirement applies for vehicles purchased on or
after August 17, 2022. Additional critical mineral and battery component
requirements also apply as of April 18, 2023, which alter how the tax
credit is calculated and may alter the amount of the tax credit
available. These latter requirements came into effect upon the
publication of the Treasury Department's guidance document regarding the
critical mineral and battery component requirements. Vehicles that meet
the critical mineral requirements are eligible for a \$3,750 tax credit,
and vehicles that meet the battery component requirements are eligible
for a \$3,750 tax credit. Vehicles meeting both the critical mineral and
the battery component requirements are eligible for a total tax credit
of \$7,500.

Vans, sport utility vehicles, and pickup trucks must not have an MSRP
above \$80,000, and all other vehicles may not have an MSRP above
\$55,000. The MSRP can be found on the vehicle's window sticker, which
is also known as the ""Monroney label""; the MSRP for this purpose
includes any trim, options, or accessories for the particular vehicle
and excludes the destination fee and dealer-provided options and
accessories.

Additionally, a taxpayer's eligibility for the tax credit may be limited
by thresholds for modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI); only
individuals having a modified AGI below the following thresholds for the
current tax year or the prior tax year are eligible for the tax credit:

-   \$300,000 for joint filers
-   \$225,000 for head-of-household filers
-   \$150,000 for all other filers

To be eligible for the Clean Vehicle Credit, the battery powering the
vehicle must have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). The
amount of the credit depends on whether the vehicle meets certain
critical minerals and battery component requirements.

**Critical Minerals:** To be eligible for the \$3,750 critical minerals
portion of the tax credit, the percentage of the value of the battery's
critical minerals that are extracted or processed in the United States
or a U.S. free-trade agreement partner or recycled in North America,
must meet or exceed the following thresholds:

Vehicles Sold on or After January 1 and Placed-in-Service Before April 18, 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) provisions
removed the manufacturer sales caps for vehicles sold after January 1,
2023, expanded the scope of eligible vehicles to include both EVs and
FCEVs, and required that the battery powering the vehicle has a capacity
of at least seven kilowatt-hours (kWh). An available tax credit under
the CVC may be limited by the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail
price (MSRP) and the buyer's modified adjusted gross income (as
addressed above). The North American final assembly requirement
continues to apply.

For vehicles placed in service before April 18, 2023, the available CVC
tax credit is a base amount of \$2,500 plus, for a vehicle that draws
propulsion energy from a battery with at least 7 kWh of capacity, \$417,
plus an additional \$417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in
excess of 5 kWh. The total tax credit available for a vehicle may not
exceed \$7,500.

Vehicles Purchased Between August 17 and December 31, 2022
----------------------------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased and delivered between August 17, 2022, and
December 31, 2022, are eligible for the tax incentive as described below
for vehicles purchased before August 17, 2022, but are limited to
[vehicles with final assembly in North
America](https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxcenter.shtml). Manufacturer
sales caps on vehicles apply. Note that for some manufacturers, the
assembly location may vary because some models are produced in multiple
locations. The assembly location of a particular vehicle should be
confirmed by referring to its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) using
the U.S. Department of Transportation's [VIN
decoder](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vin-decoder) or an information label
affixed to the vehicle.

Vehicles Purchased Before August 17, 2022
-----------------------------------------

Qualifying EVs purchased before August 17, 2022, are eligible for a tax
credit that is available for the purchase of a new qualified EV that
draws propulsion from a battery that has at least five kilowatt-hours
(kWh) of capacity, uses an external source of energy to charge the
battery, has a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,000 pounds, and
meets specified emission standards. The minimum credit amount is
\$2,500, and the credit may be up to \$7,500 based on each vehicle's
traction battery capacity. The credit will begin to be phased out for
each manufacturer in the second quarter following the calendar quarter
in which a minimum of 200,000 qualified PEVs have been sold by that
manufacturer for use in the United States. This tax credit is also
available for future EV owners with a written binding contract to
purchase a new qualifying electric vehicle before August 16, 2022, but
do not take possession of the vehicle until on or after August 16, 2022.

11675,US,National Alternative Fuels Corridors,"The U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) designates a national network of electric vehicle (EV) charging
and hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure along
national highway system corridors. To designate these Alternative Fuel
Corridors (AFC), FHWA solicits nominations from state and local
officials and works with other federal officials and industry
stakeholders.

FHWA must establish an AFC [grant
program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12730) to award grants to eligible
entities, by November 15, 2022. During the designation and redesignation
process, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy, FHWA will
issue a report identifying charging and fueling infrastructure, best
practices and guidance for predictable infrastructure deployment,
analyzing standardization needs for fuel providers and purchasers, and
reestablishing the goal of achieving strategic deployment of fueling
infrastructure in the designated corridors.

For the [2023 Request for Nominations
(RFN)](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/nominations/2023_request_for_nominations_r7.pdf),
state and local officials must submit nominations to FHWA by June 21,
2023. State and local agencies may nominate additional corridors, extend
currently designated corridors, nominate another fuel along an already
designated corridor, and update the status of previously designated
corridors.

The Round 7 RFN and AFC designation is tied to funding eligibility under
the [NEVI Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure
Discretionary Grant Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12744). The
FHWA encourages nominations that focus on EV charging infrastructure
along Interstate corridors, but nominations may also be submitted
elsewhere on the National Highway System. Corridor projects along Round
7 AFCs are not eligible for the [2023 Notice of Funding Opportunity for
the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant
Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12732), which closes June 13,
2023. When considering Round 7 nominations, FHWA strongly encourages
segments of Interstates that do not currently have an EV designation,
particularly longer Interstate segments that provide important through
connectivity to adjoining States.

FHWA is also requesting input on proposed Freight EV Corridors
designation, outlined in the Round 7 RFN.

FHWA must update and redesignate corridors periodically thereafter. For
more information, including FHWA areas of interest for corridor
designations and infrastructure development, see the FHWA
