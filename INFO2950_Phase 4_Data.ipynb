    "## Data Descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n",
    "- **Observations**:  \n",
    "  Each row in the dataset represents a specific entity (e.g., a year-state combination for state-level EV registrations or federal incentives).  \n",
    "- **Attributes**:  \n",
    "  - **Year**  \n",
    "  - **State**  \n",
    "  - **Total EV registrations**\n",
    "  - **Total EV registrations per Capita**\n",
    "  - **Lowest EV Price of the Year**\n",
    "  - **Population (by State by Year)**\n",
    "  - **Federal Incentives Count (by year)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "The dataset was created to explore and analyze the factors influencing electric vehicle (EV) adoption across states, focusing on variables such as federal incentives, pricing, renewable energy production, and infrastructure availability. This analysis aims to provide insights into how policy and economic factors shape EV adoption trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "The dataset compilation and underlying sources are funded by public organizations such as:\n",
    "- U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n",
    "- U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\n",
    "- Open Charge Map\n",
    "- U.S. Census Bureau \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded, and what was not?\n",
    "- Data accuracy may vary depending on reporting standards and processes across states.  \n",
    "- External events, such as changes in data collection methods or interruptions (e.g., pandemic years), may influence what was observed or omitted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "- Converted EV registration data into numeric formats.  \n",
    "- Analyzed and selected the top 5 states in EV growth and registrations.  \n",
    "- Filtered the EV registration data for the selected 5 states: `California`, `Florida`, `Texas`, `Washington`, `New Jersey`.  \n",
    "- Converted EV Manufacturer Suggested Retail Prices (MSRP) data into numeric formats and dropped NaN values.  \n",
    "- Calculated the lowest EV price of the year.\n",
    "- Merged the filtered registration data with the lowest prices by `Year`.\n",
    "- Removed unnecessary columns (Law Id, Text, Agency, Topic, etc.) from incentives dataset.\n",
    "- Converted enactment and expiration dates to datetime format and filtered for US-level incentives only. \n",
    "- Manually added missing enactment dates for specific policies.\n",
    "- Created a yearly count of active federal incentives.\n",
    "- Combined the cleaned federal incentives data with the merged dataset of EV registrations and lowest prices using `Year` and `State` as the common key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection, and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "- As the data primarily originates from governmental agencies and public resources, individuals contributing to or represented in the data (e.g., EV owners) may not have been directly aware of its collection.  \n",
    "- Agencies and organizations were likely aware that the data would be used for research, policy evaluation, and public awareness campaigns.\n",

It offers a range of functionalities, including retrieving nearby charging stations, filtering stations by country, operator, or status, and contributing data such as new locations or updates. The API supports JSON and XML formats, allowing developers to integrate charging point information into apps, navigation systems, or research projects. The data is community-driven and free to use."

We cleaned the data by renaming columns, removing unnecessary ones like Census, and fixing state names by stripping leading dots. Then, we filtered the data to keep only the five selected states—California, Florida, Texas, Washington, and New Jersey—and removed commas from population values to convert them into numbers. Population data for 2016–2019 and 2020–2023 was combined into one dataset and reshaped into a long format with State, Year, and Population columns. This was merged with the EV registrations data using State and Year as keys. Finally, we calculated the EV registrations per capita by dividing the total EV registrations by the population for each state and year, adding the result as a new column to the dataset."

    "The federal incentives data cleaning process began with loading the raw data from a CSV file named 'state_laws_and_incentives.csv' into a pandas DataFrame. This initial dataset contained comprehensive information about various laws and incentives related to alternative fuels and vehicles across different jurisdictions. To make the data more focused for our analysis, we removed several columns that were not relevant. These included fields such as 'Law Id', 'Text', 'Recent?', and others related to agency details, dates of updates or repeals, and references. Removing these columns allowed us to concentrate on the key information needed to study federal incentives for electric vehicles.The next step addressed inconsistencies in the 'Enacted Date' and 'Expired Date' columns. These date fields were in mixed formats, which could lead to errors when analyzing time-based trends. Using pandas’ pd.to_datetime() function, we converted these columns into a consistent datetime format."
